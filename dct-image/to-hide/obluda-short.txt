Everyone was gone, so the boy went on a journey.
He walked for days and days. One day, the boy came upon the monster who had gone west.
"I have a name. It's a wonderful name." Said the boy.
The monster who went west replied.
"I don't need a name. I'm perfectly happy without one, after all, that's what we are--nameless monsters."
The boy ate up the monster who went west.
At last he had found a name, but there was no longer anyone around to call him by it.
Such a shame, because Johan was such a wonderful name.
